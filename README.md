# TrustChain Super App 
[![Build Status](https://github.com/Tribler/trustchain-superapp/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Tribler/trustchain-superapp/actions) [![ktlint](https://img.shields.io/badge/ktlint%20code--style-%E2%9D%A4-FF4081)](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/)

This repository contains a collection of Android apps built on top of [IPv8](https://github.com/Tribler/kotlin-ipv8) (our P2P networking stack) and [TrustChain](https://github.com/Tribler/kotlin-ipv8/blob/master/doc/TrustChainCommunity.md) (a scalable, distributed, pair-wise ledger). All applications are built into a single APK, following the concept of [super apps](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/06/super-app-or-super-disruption.html) â€“ an emerging trend that provides an ecosystem for multiple services within a single all-in-one app experience.

## Build Instructions

### Clone
Clone the repository **including the submodule** with the following command:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules <URL>
```

If you have already cloned the repository and forgot to include the `--recurse-submodules` flag, you can initialize the submodule with the following command:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
You can also update the submodule with this command.

### Build
If you want to build an APK, run the following command:
```
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```
The resulting APK will be stored in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Install
You can also build and automatically install the app on all connected Android devices with a single command:
```
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```
*Note: It is required to have an Android device connected with USB debugging enabled before running this command.*

### Check
Run the Gradle check task to verify that the project is correctly set up and that tests pass:
```
./gradlew check
```
*Note: this task is also run on the CI, so ensure that it passes before making a PR.*  

### Tests
Run unit tests:
```
./gradlew test
```

Run instrumented tests:
```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

### Code style
[Ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) is used to enforce a consistent code style across the whole project. It is recommended to install the [ktlint plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15057-ktlint) for your IDE to get real-time feedback.

Check code style:
```
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```

Apply linter:
```
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

## Adding Your Own App
If you want to add your own app to the TrustChain Super App, you can follow the tutorial in the [AppTutorial.md](doc/AppTutorial.md) document.

## Apps

### Debug

**Debug** shows various information related to connectivity, including:

- The list of bootstrap servers and their health. The server is considered to be alive if we receive a response from it within the last 120 seconds.
- The number of connected peers in the loaded overlays.
- The LAN address estimated from the network interface and the WAN address estimated from the packets received from peers outside of our LAN.
- The public key and member ID (SHA-1 hash of the public key)
- TrustChain statistics (the number of stored blocks and the length of our chain)

### MusicDAO
In short, the MusicDAO  is an IPv8 app where users can share and discover tracks on the trustchain. Track streaming, downloading, and seeking interactions are done using JLibtorrent.

A user can publish a Release (which is an album/EP/single/...), after which the app creates a magnet link referring to these audio tracks. Then, the app creates a proposal block for the Trustchain which contains some metadata (release date, title, ...) this metadata is submitted by the user with a dialog. When a signed block is discovered (currently self-signed), the app tries to obtain the file list using JLibtorrent. Each file can be streamed independently by clicking the _play_ button.

**Videos**

Video 1: <a href="doc/musicdao/thesis2.mp4">Load example.</a> This uses a default magnet link for an album that has a decent amount of peers. The user submits the metadata and the block gets proposed and signed. Then playback.

Video 2: <a href="doc/musicdao/thesis3.mp4">Share track.</a> Note: as a fresh magnet link is generated in this video, there is only 1 peer. For this reason, it will be difficult to obtain the metadata of the magnet link (cold start issues) so the video stops there.
